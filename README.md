# OpenCV - Virtual Keyboard

## Why

I've been interested in getting into computer vision, so I created this project to gain a basic understanding of the libraries used and to practice Python. My main goal is to work on more meaningful projects that can be useful in the real world.

## What it does


## Tech Stack
- Python
- MediaPipe Hands:  A hand landmark ML model that operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints.
- OpenCV: For video processing and rendering the keyboard interface.
- cvzone: For hand-tracking and gesture recognition.
- Pynput: For simulating keyboard inputs.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical operations in image processing.

You can test it out right now!
